# Lessons Learned
Attempting daily coding exercises has greatly improved my problem-solving and analytical thinking skills. The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless array of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
